			<h3>It's finally over</h3>

				<article>
					<p>So it's finally over, with the arrival of the dark knight, the modern Batman trilogy comes to an end and thank god, I must have lost a good amount of time laughing at these movies and I'm sure everybody knows what that reason is since almost everybody I know and all over the internet trough websites focusing on comedy, that stupid voice has been all over the place. It got annoying as well but not too bad. Oh right the film...I never saw it.<br />

			<h3>Seth McFarlane made a movie</h3>

				<article>
					<p>Hey guess what people who suffers from OCD, Seth McFarlane made a movie and it's about a guy who dates Meg and has a teddy bear that talks like peter griffin, and it likes, does funny things like date real people which is weird cause how will that work and now that I think about it how will that work now. I'm curious, aren't you curious, I'm really curious, hold on I'm gonna look for a talking teddy bear...Speaking of family guy, they do really good covers of songs from the Music Man.</p>

			<h3>Pixar's first disney princess movie...weird huh?</h3>
		</hgroup>	
				<article>
					<p>So yeah,Pixar made their first disney princess-type of film and I heard it was like...meh. You know what I really I'm really excited for, Monsters University and Wreck-it Ralph even though that one isn't even a Pixar film (looks like one, though), and I heard that their could be a sequel to The Incredibles and if they do, Brad Bird better be on board cause if not then I don't think it'll be as fantastic as the first film.</p>

					<p>I loved the first three Sam Reimi (is that right) Spiderman films, no wait, scratch that, I love the first two, I laughed at the third one. Kinda surprised he can turn that into a comedy about a guy in suit and- what...it-it's not a comedy?.......Nooo, Come on, that's a comedy, I mean who acts like that much of dork and who dances like that in public, I mean granted I can't dance for my own survival but there's no does is supposed to be serious and-.....wait, this is-this is really meant to be taking serious....wow....they messed up badly this time. </p>

					<p>So it's finally over, with the arrival of the dark knight, the modern Batman trilogy comes to an end and thank god, I must have lost a good amount of time laughing at these movies and I'm sure everybody knows what that reason is since almost everybody I know and all over the web trough websites focusing on comedy, that stupid voice has been all over the place. It got annoying as well but no too bad. Oh right the film...I never saw it.</p<

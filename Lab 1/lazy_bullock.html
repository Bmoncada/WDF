			<h1>How to be a lazy bullock</h1>
			<p>Hey there, I see you being such a busy working bee, being all responsible and stuff, but lately you've been thinking that you get no joy out of it, no...fun or pleasure...........or cheese puffs. OOOooohHHhhooOh, those delicious little orange, cheesie, blood clot induc-uh, wait was I doing? Huh?! he-hey! Where are my clothes?!!</p>
				
			<h2>Here are some tips</h2>	
				<ol>
					<li>The first thing you do should into how to be a lazy freak is to not care aout anything, like nothing let your mind be a total blank. Once you reached a state that equals Nirvana, then you can start to focus on how to be lazy or a mormon or something.</li>
					<li>Next up is to understand how the tv works, if you were born in the early 1900s then skip this, if you were born earlier the forget about it, I'm too lazy to explain</li>
					<li>Lastly, find something to keep you entertain as you sit on the couch doing, yeah a little contradictive but, hey, we all have to make sacrifices.</li>
				</ol>

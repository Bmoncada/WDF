		Go to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/" title="Dog on a Skatebaord!!">Youtube</a> for the moving funnies.</p>
		<p>Youtube is a video-sharing site that can allow users to view, and upload videos.<br />
		As I checked through the 508 Section and the Accessibility check, it seems that a majority of issues in this site are about the img element and that a lot of them don't have the alt attribute or those that do have the attribute don't have any values in them. It would be best that to get rid of a good chunk of the problems would be to check on the img elements and to see if the attributes are being properly placed and their values filled out.</p>

			Click at the blue text right...<a href="http://www.cheezburger.com/?fromono=true">here</a> so you can laugh for all eternity,...or for ten minutes, however you prefer.</p>
			<p>Cheezburger is a multi-media sharing site that lets users share content of different kinds (mostly images with captions) and others get to vote on wether it is funny or not.<br />
			From both of the checkers, this site has many accessibility problems, ranging from img elements not having alt attributes, to input elements not having proper labels, and also link text not being meaningful. The developer is going to have to look through their code very extensively in order to clear all these different problems by giving the link code more meaning and to give the img elements their necessary attributes.</p>

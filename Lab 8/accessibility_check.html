		Go to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a> for the moving funnies.<br />
		Youtube is a video-sharing site that can allow users to view, and upload videos.<br />
		As I checked through the 508 Section and the Accessibility check, it seems that a majority of issues in this site are about the <code>img<code> element and that a lot of them don't have the <code>alt<code> attribute or those that do have the attribute don't have any values in them. It would be best that to get rid of a good chunk of the problems would be to check on the <code>img<code> elements and to see if the attributes are being properly placed and their values filled out.</p>

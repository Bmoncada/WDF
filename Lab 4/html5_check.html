				<p>Even though this is part of the showcase, this doesn't have that much html5 structure, at least from what I can tell, this is more of a flash that seems to draw inspiration from angry birds and from what the outliner tells me, this site only has one <em>Untitled Section</em> so by fixing that, then one thing the designer can do is either give the section a heading or remove it altogether.</p>

			<h2>Bazar Coffee Shop</h2>
				<p><a href="http://www.bazarcoffeeandtea.com/" title="Come in and indulge on your caffine addiction.">http://www.bazarcoffeeandtea.com/</a></p>
				<p><img src="images/coffee_shop.png" alt="A coffee shop with a friendly face" title="doesn't she look sweet?" width="800" hieght="800" /></p>
				<p>For all you caffine addicts, this is one website you want to go to since as the website describes a coffee shop from somewhere in the world and shows the different kinds of drinks they have from coffees to expressos and lattes to the little delicious sweet snacks they have avalaible like cookies or "crumpets", while invoking an environment where you can just put your legs up to relax. Now when you see a site that looks this pretty, it gives the attention that it's nothing but a pile crap with a golden sheen. But that doesn't seem to be the case as from the outliner, it is very well structured with a really good hierarchy with it's only problem being that it has some <em>Untitled Sections</em> at the top of the hierarchy and by adding headings or removing some of them should fix the problem.</p>

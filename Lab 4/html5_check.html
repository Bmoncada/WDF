				<p>Even though this is part of the showcase, this doesn't have that much html5 structure, at least from what I can tell, this is more of a flash that seems to draw inspiration from angry birds and from what the outliner tells me, this site only has one <em>untitled section</em> so by fixing that, then one thing the designer can do is either give the section a heading or remove it altogether.</p>

				<h2>How each element should be used in it's proper way</h2>
			</hgroup>
			<p>This document will be a list containing various HTML5 elements, by explaining what they are and also by showing an example. The explanation will be brief so it won't be too long, confusing, and sometimes idiotic, like ya know, a Stephen King novel.</p>

		<h2>&lt;abbr&gt;</h2>
			<p>This element represents a word or words shortened.</p>
		<strong>Example:</strong>
			<p>You know in so many <abbr>RPG</abbr>s, (Role Playing Games) there just seems to be too many <abbr>ROUS</abbr>s, (Rodents Of Unusual Size) especially in <abbr>MMO</abbr>s, (Massive Multiplayer Online) that it's practically hilariously, like seriously, <abbr>LOL</abbr>, (Laugh Out Loud), WTF (What The Fudge).</p>

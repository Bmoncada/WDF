				<h1>HTML5 Elements</h1>
				<h2>How each element should be used in it's proper way</h2>
			</hgroup>
			<p>This document will be a list containing various HTML5 elements, by explaining what they are and also by showing an example. The explanation will be brief so it won't be too long, confusing, and sometimes idiotic, like ya know, a Stephen King novel.</p>
		</section>
		
		<hr />
		
		<h2>&lt;abbr&gt;</h2>
			<p>This element represents a word or words shortened.</p>
		<strong>Example:</strong>
			<p>You know in so many <abbr>RPG</abbr>s, (Role Playing Games) there just seems to be too many <abbr>ROUS</abbr>s, (Rodents Of Unusual Size) especially in <abbr>MMO</abbr>s, (Massive Multiplayer Online) that it's practically hilariously, like seriously, <abbr>LOL</abbr>, (Laugh Out Loud).</p>
			
		<br />
			
		<h2>&lt;title attribute&gt;</h2>
			<p>Not to be confused with the element, used in common with the &lt;abbr&gt; element and specifies additional information with a tooltip appearing when the cursor is hovered over.</p>
		<strong>Example:</strong>
			<p><em>(this is what the previous example looks like with title attribute, just hover over them BIG letters.)</em></p>
			<p>You know in so many <abbr title="(Role Playing Games)">RPG</abbr>s, there just seems to be too many <abbr title="(Rodents Of Unusual Size)">ROUS</abbr>s, especially in <abbr title="(Massive Multiplayer Online)">MMO</abbr>s, that it's practically hilariously, like seriously, <abbr title="(Laugh Out Loud)">LOL</abbr>.</p>
			
		<br />
			
		<h2>&lt;address&gt;</h2>
			<p>An element best used for contact information.</p>
		<strong>Example:</strong>
			<p>Ever since I listened to that song from Green Day were they mentioned a place called Jingletown, I would begin to imagine what my address would be for my place.</p>
			<address>1990,Double Rainbow St,
			<br />
			12345,Jingletown,CA</address>
			<p>That would be awesome.</p>
			
			<br />
			
		<h2>&lt;b&gt;</h2>
			<p>Shows text in a <b>Bold</b> font and is meant to used for stylistic offset</p>
		<strong>Example:</strong>
			<p>I <b>seriously</b> doubt that Twilight is as <b>bad</b> as anyone says.
			<br />			   
			<em>sometime later,</em>
			<br />
			As I thought, that <b>pony</b> wasn't as bad as I thought</p>
			
			<br />
			
		<h2>&lt;i&gt;</h2>
			<p>Shows text in a <i>italics</i> and is meant to used for alternative voice</p>
		<strong>Example:</strong>
			<p>Bravo ten, Bravo ten can you hear me, over?
			<br />
			<i>what is it Bravo nine?</i>
			<br />
			...It's lonley here...over
			<br />
			<i>...*sigh*...ya I know, Bravo nine, please shut up.</i></p>
			
			<br />
						
		<h2>&lt;code&gt;</h2>
			<p>shows text in <code>monospaced</code> and it represents computer code.</p>
		<strong>Example:</strong>
			<p>Back around the 90s, video games that were made for computers didn't have a lot vocal dialogue featured in and for those that did have them, I would get really creeped out, just imagine the voice it would be, <code>like it would be like this, in this robotic, detached voice</code>,     just freaks me out.</p>
			
		<h2>&lt;del&gt; and &lt;ins&gt;</h2>
			<p>&lt;del&gt; represents content that is removed from a document while &lt;ins&gt; represents content that is an additional to the document.</p>
		<strong>Example: (note, after OBJECTION! press play for the audio for extra fun, but if you've never played Ace Attorney, this joke will fly by you)</strong>
			<p>Have you ever known that Brandon was the most common name in the world.
			<br />
			<i>PW: OBJECTION!</i>
			<br />
			<audio controls="controls" preload="none">
				<source src="cornered.theora.ogv" type="audio/ogg" />
			</audio>
			<br />
			What the-
			<br />
			<i>PW: According to the multiple facts around the web, Mohammed is the most common name in the world, not Brandon.</i>
			<br />
			Uhhh, where's that music coming from?
			<br />
			<i>PW: Which means your statement should be like this:</i> Have you ever known that <del datetime="2012-08-08" cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_%28name%29">Brandon</del> <ins>Mohammed</ins> was the most common name in the world. 
			<br />
			Um, thank yo-
			<br>
			<i>PW: Which makes you the culprit, Admit it!</i>
			<br> 			
			Huh?!, for what?! 
			</p>
			
			<h2>&lt;detail&gt; and &lt;summary&gt;</h2>
			<p>&lt;detail&gt; represents an interactive disclosure widget without Javascript, and it can hide and show content with the use of the &lt;summary&gt; element.</p>
		<strong>Example:</strong>
			<p><detail>
					<summary></p>		  	
			
		<h2>&lt;&gt;</h2>
			<p></p>
		<strong>Example:</strong>
			<p></p>	   	
	</body>
</html>

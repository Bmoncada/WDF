			<h2><a href="http://www.google.com/" title="Sends ya to google">Google</a></h2>
				<p>Google is a search engine site that people use in order to search for information that they need to find quickly. I use it as a spell checker sometimes, u mad bro.</p>
				<p>It did not pass the validation check, having 28 errors and 4 warnings, with attributes and entities being there major offenders. The designers should either use CSS for the entites issues or actually use the proper entity code see weather their attributes are on the right place.</p>

			<h2><a href="http://www.joystiq.com/" title="This thingie takes you to that joy place">Joystiq.com</a></h2>
				<p>Joystiq is a videogame news site in the shape of a blog and posts up to date game news.
				<p>It did not pass validation, having 95-97 errors with all the errors being a mix of all kinds incorrect and illegal coding.</p>

				<p> Ibuypower is an online store that sells high-end PCs that are built for the main purpose of playing games.</p>
				<p>This site did not pass validation with having up to 150 errors, and while similar to the kinds of errors being varied like Joystiq, I see a lot of div erors, with the div element being misused and misplaced. The designer will have to either delete the misused divs and move the misplaced ones into their proper place.

			<h2><a href="http://www.khanacademy.org" title="You want to be smarter, right?">Khan Academy</a></h2>
				<p>Khan Academy is an educational site that has dozens to hundreds of videos covering many subjects, mostly from basic to advanced math as well as some current events.
				</p>?The website did not pass validation, with nearly half of it's errors being that the HTML5 uses the "name" attribute and fixing that can be simple by just replacing the obsolete attribute with the "ID" attribute.

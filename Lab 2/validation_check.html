				<p>Google is a search engine site that people use in order to search for information that they need to find quickly. I use it as a spell checker sometimes, u mad bro.</p>
				<p>It did not pass the validation check, having 28 errors and 4 warnings, with attributes and entities being there major offenders. The designers should either use CSS for the entites issues or actually use the proper entity code see weather their attributes are on the right place.</p>

			<h2>JPG image</h2>
				<p><img src="images/headset.jpg" alt="A 360 Headset" width="550" height="550" /></p>
				<p>This headset was used for my ACG class as my subject for my mechanical object. this photo cam irregular and instead used a photo online of the same headset that was a lot better but I couldn't find that and used this bad one instead.</p>

			<h2>PNG-24 image</h2>
				<p><img src="images/layout.png" alt="ACG Layout"  width="676" height="500"/></p>
				<p>This would be the final layout for my ACG class by using my mechanical object and creating an Ad that would be relevant to the object that was used. In total, must hav taken my around 17 hours to getting everything the way I wanted.</p>

			<h2>GIF/PNG-8 image</h2>
				<p><img src="images/xbox_360_logo.gif" alt="Xbox 360 Logo" width="500" height="380" /></p>
				<p>I might be cheating here, but this logo was used a whole lot for the creation of my final layout for the creation of the ad for my headset but no matter what did, the logo wouldn't make sense anywhere but what it did do was give me the idea of what my on version of a 360 logo should look like since imagery of green waves and lines are almost always present with the logo, I thought how it would look with just the waves in a stylized way.</p>
